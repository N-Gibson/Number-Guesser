 Guesser

by: Noah Gibson and Alyssa Lundgren

## Introduction
Number Guesser is a game that randomly generates a number on page load between the predefined parameters of 1 to 100. The game compares player guess inputs to the random number providing feedback to the players along the way. When a player guesses the random number a BOOM! message is display and a game card is populated in the Trophy Case with the challenger names and and match winner's information. While the game could be played against the computer by one solo player, like all things, Number Guesser is best played with a friend. 

### Custom Range Inputs
Players are given the opportunity to set custom range parameters to increase or decrease the game difficulty. 

## The Project and Our Process
The Number Guesser was a first for our team in many ways. In addition to our first paired projects, the Number Guesser was our first foyer into interactive web development, requiring our page to listen for user actions on the page and respond using the input. 

Prior to sitting down to write any code, we began pen to paper drawing the comp and disucssing the contents of the page as a group. Whiteboarding the provided Number Guesser design before writing any code allowed our team to develop semantic HTML from the very beginning. 

From there, we focused on building out the structure within HTML and styling the page using CSS. We split the work up (since we both had previous experience using these languages) and once we felt good about the structure and styling we refactored our code. Organizing the files, deleting excess elements, and ensuring our IDs and elements were consistent and descriptive. 

While working through the CSS and HTML we began implementing our GitHub workflow, another first for our team. We created a local project folder, initialized git, created a remote repo, and added collaborators. We learned how to pull from master, create branches, push branches, submit pull requests, review/approve/merge pull requests, and communicate amoungst our team along the way. 

Prior to beginning the project our team had decided that we both wanted to get as much out of the project as possible. We did not feel comfortable splitting up the JavaScript since we both wanted equal practice so we worked together, pairing side-by-side throughout the development of the JavaScript functionality. 

## Team Reflection
We feel this project was very successful. We were able to pair effectively, solve problems, and buildout a functioning number guesser game taking user inputs to update the page. We worked well as a team, encouraging one another, and addressing challenges as they arose. We recognize there are always ways to improve but are happy with the process and the product.
